# Faculty Feedback - Randy Guthrie #
## Tutoring Match-Making

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).

## Week 10 Oct 26 ##
- SCRUM Lead: Edwin
- Not enough "labeled" work for the week (some stories labeled for Week 11 in backlog being actively worked
- Board hygiene: keep story status/columns up to date: maybe a mid-week quick sync to move stories across the board?
- Better preparation to "show" your work to your faculty mentor
- 

## Week 11 ##

 - SCRUM Lead: Edwin (again) others having mic problems; typically they work in Discord
 - Maryrose demo'd screen graphics (having each team member demo their completed work is a best practice)
 - Finished work included bug fixes
 - Next feature is allowing users to create 1:1 sessions
 - [Strongly Suggested] There is not enough work in the backlog to finish your project. Please spend some time thinking about what is needed for the Dry Run and Final Presentation and create the stories
 - Each person should be doing backlog basics ie: writing stories, making code commits, approving pull requests
